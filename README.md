## üéØ Key Metrics & Calculations

### Inventory Metrics
```
Safety Stock = Z-score(Service Level) √ó Demand Standard Deviation
Reorder Point = (Average Demand √ó Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Turnover Ratio = Total Demand / Average Inventory
```

### Forecast Accuracy Metrics
```
Bias = Average of (Forecast - Actual)
MAE = Average of |Forecast - Actual|
MAPE = Average of |Forecast - Actual| / |Actual| √ó 100
Forecast Accuracy = 100% - MAPE
```

### Supply Chain Metrics
```
Capacity Utilization = Required Capacity / Available Capacity √ó 100
Supplier Score = Weighted Average of (Cost, Quality, Lead Time, Capacity)
```

### Financial Metrics
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue √ó 100
Budget Variance = Actual - Budget
Cash Flow Forecast = Historical Trend + Seasonal Adjustment
```

### S&OP Metrics
```
Plan Balance Score = % of periods with <5% volume gap
Volume Gap = Supply - Demand
Consensus Level = Based on coefficient of variation across stakeholders
```

### S&OE Metrics
```
Execution Score = 100 - |Variance %|
KPI Achievement = Actual / Target √ó 100
Issue Resolution Rate = Resolved Issues / Total Issues √ó 100
```
