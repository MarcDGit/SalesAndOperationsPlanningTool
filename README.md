## üéØ Key Metrics & Calculations

### Safety Stock Formula
```
Safety Stock = Z-score(Service Level) √ó Demand Standard Deviation
```

### Reorder Point Formula
```
Reorder Point = (Average Demand √ó Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

### Inventory Turnover
```
Turnover Ratio = Total Demand / Average Inventory
Days on Hand = 365 / (Turnover Ratio √ó 52)
```

### ABC Classification
- **A Items**: Top 80% of demand value (high priority)
- **B Items**: Next 15% of demand value (medium priority)  
- **C Items**: Bottom 5% of demand value (low priority)

### Forecast Accuracy Metrics

#### Traditional Metrics

##### Bias (Mean Error)
```
Bias = Average of (Forecast - Actual)
```
- **Interpretation**: Positive values indicate over-forecasting, negative values indicate under-forecasting

##### MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
```
MAE = Average of |Forecast - Actual|
```
- **Interpretation**: Lower values indicate better accuracy (same unit as sales data)

##### MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
```
MAPE = Average of |Forecast - Actual| / |Actual| √ó 100
```
- **Interpretation**: Expressed as percentage; <10% excellent, 10-20% good

##### RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
```
RMSE = ‚àö(Average of (Forecast - Actual)¬≤)
```
- **Interpretation**: Penalizes large errors more heavily; lower values are better

#### Industry-Standard Accuracy Metrics (0-100% Scale)

##### Forecast Accuracy
```
Forecast Accuracy = 100% - MAPE
```
- **Interpretation**: Direct accuracy percentage; ‚â•90% excellent, 80-90% good, <80% needs improvement
- **Industry Standard**: Most widely used accuracy metric in supply chain and forecasting

##### Weighted Accuracy
```
Weighted Accuracy = 100% - (Average of Capped Relative Errors √ó 100)
```
- **Interpretation**: Sophisticated accuracy measure that caps extreme outliers at 200%
- **Usage**: More robust than standard accuracy for datasets with occasional large errors

##### Tracking Signal
```
Tracking Signal = Bias / MAE
```
- **Interpretation**: Bias detection metric; typical acceptable range is -4 to +4
- **Industry Standard**: Used to identify systematic forecasting bias
- **Thresholds**: <2 in control, 2-4 monitor, ‚â•4 out of control
